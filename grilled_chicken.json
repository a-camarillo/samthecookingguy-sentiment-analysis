Are you ready?\n\nHi everyone, I hope you're doing well. If you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re alive and breathing then this message is for you: God loves you so, so much, you can not fathom His love for you! It doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s you\u2019re gender, your luck so far in life, or what you have done in your past, God came in the flesh in a man named Jesus Christ and gave His life to take the punishment that should have been yours. God is waiting on all of us to repent so He can have mercy on us, and so He can reveal Himself to us (Luke 11:1-13, and Matthew 11:27-30). God\u2019s love for you is the strongest force in existence. Stronger than gravity, and stronger than whatever you\u2019re going through right now. If you\u2019re already a believer, then never forget what you just read! And make sure your relationship with the Heavenly Father is active, real, honest, alive and well. Not lazy like most of us Christians are with God. People, you should NOT be talking to God \"weekly\" or \"every now and then.\" God is looking for a holy people, who know Him, who hear His voice, who live for Him, who love Him, obey His commandments, and who overcome all sin, and ONLY people who do these things will be saved (John 14:21-23, Matthew 7:21-23). If you're still in sin, repent! Any and all sin will drag you straight to hell (Luke 13:1-9). If you\u2019re a nonbeliever, humble yourself before God and go and see for yourself if what I\u2019m saying is true or not, in the Bible and in prayer. God never rejects anyone who comes to Him (John 6:37). I didn\u2019t come to argue, I was sent to change. Make a change, Christians! You aren\u2019t meant to hang around and live for yourself like everyone else! Repent! Jesus is coming soon, and the Great Tribulation is about to start!
