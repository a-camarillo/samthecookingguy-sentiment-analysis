I usually caramelize a bed of finely minced onion with a liberal dose of the spices, then lay the patties right on the onions, turn the heat up a little, and let the onions sear to the bottom of the burgers. When I flip, I gather the remaining onions into a pile and sear them onto the second sides of the patties. If you cook these past medium-rare I will find you! Cheese if you like...try a good Wisconsin butterkase! Heaven! The bun only needs a healthy dollop of mayo; the seasonings and onions will blend with the mayo to make the perfect sauce.
