Of course, just like most other men with daddy issues out there, he had no idea what he was doing. It was easy enough for me to do a favor for Hassan. Nice guy, really knew how to party.\r\n\r\nI had an extra day, a chance to explore. Found this restaurant, if you could even call it that - the place was a true definition of a hole in the wall. I'm certain it violated all sorts of health codes. Still, the meal was delicious. I mean, absolutely divine. The meat just fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they had slow cooked that thing for weeks. The lady, she was barely making ends meet, so I did what I could to make sure she could keep that place going.

What's the difference between the left sugar and the right sugar? It's quite simple actually here's the truth.\nsugar comes from working sugar canes or sugar beet.

Most of you won't even know what that is, but is just a liquid that it's left over while getting the % of sugar as high as possible. \nNow that you learned this you prob asking yourself. If sugar is white naturally then why is there brown sugar and all that? IT'S SIMPLEEEEE. White sugar is 100% sugar. Brown sugar is 96% sugar and 4% MOLASSES WITCH IS THE BLACK LIQUID YOU GET FROM purifying THE BLOODY SUGAR. You can go and test it yourself if you want. Take brown sugar and try crushing it, you'll notice it turns white. that's because the molasses it's only on the surface of the sugar not inside. \nThank me later", "Looks absolutely spectacular Sam!

Very long story short the airline broke my chair on the way back home rendering my chair dangerous to be in.

Your videos brought me out of a very dark place and I was able to snap out of it and continue on fighting for my life and my family. I was able to get another job during covid, in a wheelchair full of tats and piercings, we're looking to buy a house and with a push and support of my wife (the most amazing woman ever in my life, so blessed!)
